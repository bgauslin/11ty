We look toward our distant home in the Milky Way. But we see mostly one large intervening cluster of galaxies, called the Virgo Cluster.

Galaxies as a rule associate into orbiting clusters and groups. There is reason to believe that our Milky Way is itself an outlier of the big Virgo Cluster, responsive to its steady gravitational pull: part of a supercluster.

Out there beyond the Milky Way is a good-sized volume nearly devoid of noticeable galaxies.
