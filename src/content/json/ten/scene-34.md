That chemical message is spelled out at great length in a molecular alphabet of four letters. One alphabet serves all life, but the tale retold in every cell of the body differs from individual to individual.

The two rails of the ladder come apart during cell duplication, each to act as a template for one complete new copy of the ladder of rungs.
