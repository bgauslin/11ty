A transient view of the eternally dancing structure of stable carbon-12. Those neutrons and protons that join to form it are universal nuclear modules. Protons are found free as natural hydrogen; neutrons can be set free by energetic nuclear reaction as in the fission of uranium. Study of these particles as independent objects has revealed one more analogue to chemistry: they too react upon collisions at high enough energy to produce a host of new particles, mostly transient ones.
