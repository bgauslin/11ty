We look face-on directly at the Milky Way spiral. A hundred billion stars mutually bound by gravity encircle the central region, some passing close in, some in wider orbits.

Our own sun swings with the rest in dignited passage clockwise about the distant galactic center, once every three hundred million years.

External galaxies akin to our own are scattered throughout space as far as we can see. They too rotate slowly as they drift.
