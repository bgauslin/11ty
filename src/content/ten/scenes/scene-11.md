Only the sun is to be seen, against a background of fainter stars beyond. Once that was all we knew of the frontier of the sun’s system.

We know now that a great cloud of icy comets orbits slowly here, though invisible in the weak sunlight. We see comets only as year after year a few fall into the brighter regions near earth. There we catch sight of them, moving in the sky like temporary planets, the sun’s fires boiling out their long faint tails.
