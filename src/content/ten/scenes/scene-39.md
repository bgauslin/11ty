We see clearly the minute and massive kernel of this particular carbon atom.

Its close-packed nuclear components are in vigorous quantum motion, but here the motion is profoundly restricted and fluidlike. 

Bound by nonelectrical nuclear forces of terrible strength but of very limited reach, the six neutrons and six protons seem to touch. With twelve nuclear particles, this nucleus is dubbed carbon-12: the most common isotope of carbon, it is the modern standard of atomic weight.
