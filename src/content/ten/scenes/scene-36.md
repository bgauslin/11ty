The quantum laws of atomic scale require a description of electron motion that is more subtle and less sequential than for the moving particles of ordinary experience.

Accordingly, the dot texture shown does not map individual electrons; instead, it suggests the cloud of electrical charge the electrons paint out during their symmetrical but untrackable quantum pattern of motion.

In that cloud the surface electrons are shared by the bonded atoms.
