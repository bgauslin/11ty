Most of space looks as empty as this, the glow of distant galaxies like clotted dust. This emptiness is normal; our own bright home-world is the exception.

A tenfold larger view would show no new structure, no new void; the universe is roughly uniform at such dimensions. Novelty on so grand a scale is to be sought over time rather than from place to place. All swift change is in the past.

This view will dim slowly, for a few billion years at least, as the faint clusters drift still farther apart.
