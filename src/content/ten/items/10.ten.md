Here one central star is brighter than the rest, only because it is so much nearer. That star is the sun. The contrast between night and day, between the cold glitter of the starry sky and life-giving warmth, is the consequence simply of our planetâ€™s location next to one modest star. Once we have drawn away from the sun, we can recognize that it is one star among many stars, and all distant stars are in some way suns.
