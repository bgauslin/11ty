The paths of the outer planets fill this picture. That strongly tilted orbit belongs to little, awry Pluto. The four others are those of big Neptune, Uranus, Saturn, and Jupiter, with their many satellites. Between Jupiterâ€™s path and the sun run the inner planets in their smaller orbits. The planets circulate counterclockwise here, all in nearly the same plane, which we view at an angle. The planetary system, apart from Pluto, is flat as a pancake.
