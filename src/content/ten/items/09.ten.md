Most of the matter we know is formed into stars, spheres of gas nourished by central nuclear fires that often maintain the glow for a very long time. At this point in the journey, with no star nearby, we see the realm of the stars chiefly as a distant background, no different from the night sky we view from Earth. For several frames the star background remains unchanged: the visible stars are strewn so deep in space that these steps are small in comparison. Hence they cause no noticeable shifts.
