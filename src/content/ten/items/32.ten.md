We are inside the ruffly lymphocyte, only to face another surface, a protective membrane within the cell that encloses its nucleus. The minute pores allow materials from within to enter the larger volume of the cell. Every complete cell has such a nucleus, whose molecular products inform the entire life of the cell. In one human body are a hundred times more cells than there are stars in the Galaxy.
