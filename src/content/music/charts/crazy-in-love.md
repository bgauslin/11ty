### Beyonc√© + Jay-Z

Drum samples and track by Jay-Z.

For the verses, the left foot keeps time with eighth notes, the right hand dances on the ride cymbal with syncopated patterns, the left hand whacks the snare on 2 and 4, and the right foot barely plays at all. For a drummer, it's like the typical roles for each limb have been moved around, making it a little tricky to learn, but a whole lot of fun to play.

Also, for a pop song, the structure is kinda bananas. Songs are normally based on 8-bar verses and choruses, and the bar lengths of each in this song keep changing. While being incredibly catchy, the song is also deceptively complex.
