### Beyonc√© + Jay-Z

For a pop song, the structure is kinda bananas. Songs are normally based on 8-bar verses and choruses, and the bar lengths of each in this song keep changing and vary from 2 to 8 to 12. While being incredibly catchy, this song is also deceptively complex.

Drum samples and track by Jay-Z.
