The original floors were sanded and refinished, stud walls with insulation and new electrical were installed along the original barge board walls, and the original 12" high baseboards were reinstalled after being stripped, filled, and sanded.

This space is great for entertaining and receives ample natural light due to the north-facing entry, the side yard to the east, and windows on three walls.
