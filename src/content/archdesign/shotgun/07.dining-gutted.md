The back half of the gutted gallery space will become the kitchen and dining area. The window on the left was too rotten to be salvaged and was replaced with French doors, and a large floor heater between the window and the doorway was removed, with new flooring to match the original patched in.

The barge board wall between the gallery space and the bedroom on the other side of the wall was left exposed to reveal the houseâ€™s humble origins.
