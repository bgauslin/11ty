The shelves in the corner of the second bedroom had an earthy odor due to all the vines that had burrowed into this part of the house.

The original bathroom was old and neglected, and suffered from severe water damage and rot.

The door from the side yard to the kitchen was covered in layers of grease from the stove.

The sagging popcorn ceilings in the kitchen were the first sign of decades of water damage at the roof.
