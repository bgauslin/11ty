The shelves in the corner of the second bedroom had an earthy odor due to how
many vines had burrowed into this part of the house.

The original bathroom was old and neglected, and suffered from severe water
damage and rot.

The door from the sideyard to the kitchen was covered in layer upon layer of grease from being next to the stove.

The sagging popcorn ceilings in the kitchen were from decades of water damage at the roof.
