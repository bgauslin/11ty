The roof and walls of the demolished kitchen and bathroom resting in a pile. The rest of the rear structure would soon join that pile.

The attic had knob-and-tube electrical wiring and natural gas lines for wall-mounted sconces (which are very much in non-compliance with modern building codes).

The rear structure containing the kitchen and bathroom had to be completely demolished and rebuilt after removing the damaged structural members.

Some of the barge boards and siding on the back wall of the bedroom were so rotted you could see through them. The horizontal bands on the lower part of the walls are from wood lath that held the original plaster which crumbled to pieces once the drywall on top of it was removed.
