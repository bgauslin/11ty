A fake fireplace in a yellow living room was the first thing that greeted you upon entering.

Next was a beige bedroom with a coal-burning fireplace and closet that made the room layout awkward.

The second bedroom was a room-within-a-room you had to walk through in order to access the kitchen or bathroom.

The flooring in the first bedroom was masonite on top of wallpaper, while the second featured linoleum on top of vinyl composite tile on top of stapled sheets of lauan.
