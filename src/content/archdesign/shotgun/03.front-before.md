A fake fireplace in a yellow living room was the first thing that greeted you upon entering.

Next was a beige bedroom with a coal-burning fireplace and closet that further increased the roomâ€™s already awkward layout.

The second bedroom was a pink room-within-a-room, and you had to pass through this bedroom to use the kitchen or bathroom.

The flooring in these rooms included high-gloss wood parquet tiles adhered with asphalt to plywood attached with roofing nails; linoleum on top of vinyl composite tile on top of stapled sheets of lauan; and masonite on top of wallpaper.
