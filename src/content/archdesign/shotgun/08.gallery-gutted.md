The walls are only 1" thick, vary in width from 8" to 20", and originally arrived in New Orleans as a barge that carried goods down the Mississippi River. It was less expensive to disassemble the barges and build houses out of them than it was to send them back up the river.

The change in color on the floor is where a wall used to be, and the original heart pine flooring was in great shape after being covered up with cheap flooring for so long.
