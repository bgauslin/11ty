The walls are only 1" thick, vary in width from 8" to 20", and originally arrived in New Orleans as a barge that carried goods down the Mississippi River. It was less expensive to disassemble the barges and build houses out of them than it was to send them back up the river.

This room used to have high-gloss wood parquet floor tiles adhered with asphalt to plywood that was attached to the orginial floor with roofing nails. The original heart pine flooring was in great shape after being covered up with cheap flooring for so long.
