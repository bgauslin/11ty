All of the exterior walls are only 1" thick, vary in width from 8" to 20", and originally arrived in New Orleans as a barge that carried goods down the Mississippi River. (It was less expensive to disassemble the barges and build houses out of them than it was to send them back up the river.)

This room used to have high-gloss wood parquet floor tiles adhered with asphalt to plywood that was attached with roofing nails. The original heart pine flooring underneath it all was in great shape after being covered up for so long.
