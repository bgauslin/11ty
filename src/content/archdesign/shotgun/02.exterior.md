The house had ancient window AC units and flimsy aluminum awnings; vinyl siding and fake shutters. It was missing chimney bricks, roof coping, and siding. It was perfect!

Cat’s claw had overtaken one corner and its vines were pushing the original wood siding off of the house. Cat’s claw is nearly invincible once it takes root and has to be torn out every six months or so.

One of the side yard setbacks is only 12 inches, and the contractor had to set up in the neighbors’ yard to remove and replace the siding along one side of the house.
