The house had ancient window AC units, flimsy aluminum awnings, vinyl siding, and fake shutters.

It was also missing chimney bricks, roof coping, and wood siding boards, which allowed the rain inside.

Cat’s claw had overtaken one corner and its vines were pushing the original wood siding off of the house.

One of the sideyard setbacks is only 12 inches, so the contractor had to set up in the neighbors’ yard to remove the vines and replace the siding.
