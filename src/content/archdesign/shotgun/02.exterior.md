The house had ancient window AC units, flimsy aluminum awnings, vinyl siding, and fake shutters.

It was also missing wood siding boards, chimney bricks, and roof coping tiles, which allowed the rain inside.

Cat’s claw had overtaken one corner of the house, its vines pushing the wood siding off as they grew underneath.

One of the sideyard setbacks was only 12 inches, so contractors had to set up in the neighbor’s yard to remove vines and replace the siding.
