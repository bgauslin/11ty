Due to the original placement of the bedroom doors, you had to zig-zag from room to room since so much of the floor plan was devoted to circulation.

The wall between the first two rooms will be removed to make an open gallery space which relocates all of the circulation to a straight path along the northeast wall. No more zig-zagging through the middle of each room!
