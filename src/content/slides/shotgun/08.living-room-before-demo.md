The first room you entered from the street was the living room, and a fake fireplace was the first thing that greeted you.

To its right was the door to the first bedroom, which you had to walk through to get to the kitchen and bathroom at the rear of the house.

The floor in this room was high-gloss wood parquet tiles adhered with asphalt to plywood that was attached to the original floor with roofing nails. Removing the parquet tiles was sort of like playing Minesweeper, but with a shovel.
