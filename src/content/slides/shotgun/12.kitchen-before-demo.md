The kitchen had a door in the corner that led to the side yard, and being next to the stove, it was covered in decades of grease.

The refrigerator is to the right of the stove, and the sink and a small countertop are below the cabinets.

This part of the house was so rotted and water-damaged it had to be completely demolished and rebuiltâ€”from the roof, to the walls, to the floor, to the piers, to the footings.
