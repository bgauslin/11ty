The original bathroom was old and neglected, and suffered from severe water damage and rot. The less said about demolishing this room, the better. It was gross.

The original kitchen is on the other side of the wall to the left of the toilet, and the jalousie window above the toilet was repaired and reinstalled to bring diffused natural light into a new walk-in closet.
