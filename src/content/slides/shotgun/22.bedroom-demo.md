Some of the barge boards and siding on the back wall of the bedroom were so rotted you could see through them.

The horizontal bands on the lower part of the walls is from wood lath that held the original plaster walls. The plaster had been covered up with drywall and crumbled to pieces once the drywall was removed.

The attic was also home to knob-and-tube electrical wiring and natural gas lines for wall-mounted sconces. These were given a new home in a dumpster due to their non-compliance with modern building codes.
