Cat’s claw had overtaken this corner and its vines were pushing the original wood siding off of the house.

The side yard setback here is only 12 inches, and there’s a chain link fence with wood boards attached to it right on the property line. The contractor had to set up their equipment in the neighbors’ yards to remove and replace the siding on this side of the house.

Six months later and new gutters, downspouts, and siding make quite a difference.

Note the vines on the neighbor’s corner fence post. Cat’s claw is nearly invincible once it takes root, is pretty much everywhere in New Orleans, and had to be torn out every six months or so.
