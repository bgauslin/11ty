Cat’s claw had overtaken this corner and its vines were pushing the original wood siding off of the house.

The side yard setback here is only 12 inches, and there’s a chain link fence with wood boards attached to it right on the property line. The contractor had to set up their equipment in the neighbors’ yards to remove and replace the siding on this side of the house.
