The second bedroom was actually a room-within-a-room defined by an 8' tall L-shaped wall, and you passed through the second bedroom to get to the kitchen.

There was also a small hallway between the room-within-a-room and the bathroom, which you entered via the doorway to the left of the shelves. The corner by the shelves smelled like soil due to how much catâ€™s claw had burrowed into this part of the house.

The floor in this room was linoleum on top of vinyl composite tile on top of lauan that had been stapled to the original flooring. Prying a thousand staples out one-by-one with nippers was a very Zen-like experience.
