The original bathroom was old and neglected, and suffered from severe water damage and rot. The original kitchen is on the other side of the wall to the left of the toilet, and the jalousie window above the toilet was repaired and reinstalled to bring diffused natural light into a new walk-in closet.

The kitchen had a door in the corner that led to the side yard, and being next to the stove, it was covered in decades of grease. This part of the house was so rotted and water-damaged it had to be completely demolished and rebuiltâ€”from the roof, to the walls, to the floor, to the piers, to the footings.
