Demolition plan showing the original room layout.

You had to zig-zag from room to room due to the original placement of the doors, so a fair amount of the floor plan was devoted to circulation.

The wall between the first two rooms will be removed to make an open gallery space, and this will also move the circulation to a straight path along the Northeast wall.
