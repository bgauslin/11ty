The first bedroom after the living room had a coal-burning fireplace and a closet in the corner that ate into the room’s already awkward layout.

Like many of these old fireplaces, this one was filled in with cement since burning coal indoors isn’t a very good idea. 

The flooring in this room was masonite on top of wallpaper. Yes, wallpaper.

The closet is on the opposite side of the fake fireplace in the living room and was the first amenity to be demolished.
