The first room you entered from the street was the living room, and a fake fireplace was the first thing that greeted you. To its right was the door to the first bedroom, which you had to walk through to get to the kitchen and bathroom at the rear of the house. The flooring in this room was high-gloss wood parquet tiles adhered with asphalt to plywood that was attached to the original floor with roofing nails.

The first bedroom after the living room had a coal-burning fireplace and a closet in the corner that ate into the room’s already awkward layout. The flooring in this room was masonite on top of wallpaper.

The second bedroom was actually a room-within-a-room defined by an 8' tall L-shaped wall, and you passed through the second bedroom to get to the kitchen. The shelves in the corner smelled like soil due to how much cat’s claw had burrowed into this part of the house. The flooring in this room was linoleum on top of vinyl composite tile on top of lauan that had been stapled to the original flooring. Prying a thousand staples out one-by-one with nippers was a very Zen-like experience.
