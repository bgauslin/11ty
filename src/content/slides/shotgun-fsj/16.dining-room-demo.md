The rear half of the gutted gallery space will become the kitchen and dining area.

The window on the left was too rotten to be salvaged and was replaced with French Doors, and you can see the fake mantle from the living room resting against some doors on the right.

A large floor heater between the window and the doorway was removed, and new flooring to match the original was patched in.
