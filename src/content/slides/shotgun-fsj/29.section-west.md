Longitudinal section looking West.

The bedroom and gallery space are in the original barge board volume of the house, with the rebuilt lean-to at the rear housing the laundry room, bathroom, and walk-in closet.

A fold-down ironing board was mounted to the inside face of the left-hand laundry room door, and the inside face of the right-hand laundry room door had shelves and hooks for a mop, broom, and cleaning items. Thereâ€™s also a small storage closet above the washer and dryer.
