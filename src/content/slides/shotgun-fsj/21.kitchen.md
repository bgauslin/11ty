Head-on view of the galley kitchen.

To the lower right is the HVAC return with a custom CNC-milled panel that covers a standard return grille mounted in the wall behind it. Directly above the window is a similar custom panel for an HVAC supply grille.

The white panels mounted to the face of the ceiling soffit and on the face of the HVAC return column are from IKEA, and some of them are just cabinet doors. All of the cabinets are from IKEA in standard sizes.
