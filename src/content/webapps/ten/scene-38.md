The compact core of the atom begins to appear.

The balance of atomic force is set by this nucleus, whose strong electrical attraction binds the electron dance. To bind six negatively charged electrons, exactly six positive protons must cluster within the nucleus: that number (the atomic number) defines the element carbon.

We know about a hundred distinct species of these tiny proton clusters, the elements: modular but diverse, they determine the material universe.
